## Dataset

The data for the squirrel sightings has been imported from the [2018 Central Park Squirrel Census] (https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Environment/2018-Central-Park-Squirrel-Census-Squirrel-Data/vfnx-vebw). The dataset contains 3â€™023 rows and 31 columns, each row representing a unique squirrel sighting. Each sighting includes detailed information including the location coordinates of the sighting, the physical attributes of the squirrel and the type of activity it was seen doing.
